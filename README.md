# guess-my-number
This was a small project from a Udemy Course, by Jonas Schmedtmann.

The aim of the game is to guess a number from 1 to 20(we assume during the game, that the input will not be out of these boundaries).

1. Input the guess.
2. Check the message(Correct/too low/too high).
3. Aim to guess the number as less attempts as You can, high score will be updated.
4. Once the page refreshed, the highscore is set to 0 again.
